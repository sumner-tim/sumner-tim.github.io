                Welcome to my homepage. Here you will hopefully find everything you need to know about me. Currently I am a full-time data scientist, statistical 
                researcher, and Ph.D. student, but in my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids, dancing, and training for triathlons. I try to live my 
                life surrounded by the three <i>L</i>'s: <em>L</em>ove, <em>L</em>aughter, and <em>L</em>ots of studying.
