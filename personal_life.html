      <h2>Growing Up in Sunny Tampa</h2>
      <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">(1991 - 2010)</h3>

      <div class="left" style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <p>
          Born in 1991, I spent all my youth in the sunny city of Tampa, Florida. With my father, Stephen, an electrical engineer, and my mother, Tamara, a child therapist, 
          my sister Rachel and I enjoyed a comfortable middle-class upbringing. From a young age, I was immersed in music, playing various instruments that filled my free time. 
          My mom encouraged my musical pursuits, thinking it would boost my grades, while my dad hoped it would help me impress girls. I wish I had known at this time that correlation 
          doesn’t imply causation, for I didn’t quite excel in either area!
          <br><br>
          At 13, I joined the Boy Scouts, which quickly became a cornerstone of my childhood. Growing up as the only male in my household, with my father living separately and 
          visiting occasionally, I found camaraderie and connection with other boys and men through the Boy Scouts. I cherish those memories of camping, canoeing, hiking, cooking, 
          sharpening knives, and, of course, burning stuff. 
          It was an adventure-filled time that taught me to handle all sorts of physical challenges. In 2009, I proudly became an Eagle Scout at 17, marking the first time I truly 
          felt honored for my efforts.

        <p>
          After graduating high school in 2010, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. So, naturally, I joined the US Navy and became a Hospital Corpsman. 
          Why not, right? I ended up serving one term, a grand total of five years, and it turned out to be one of the most defining periods of my life. I spent the 
          first year training in Chicago and North Carolina, the next two years at a hospital in Camp Lejuene, and the last two years with a Marine infantry Battalion 
          at Camp Pendleton. During this time, I got to travel to many different countries and meet a variety of people, some of whom I hope to stay friends with forever.
          <br><br>  
          While still enlisted, in November 2013, I took my first trip to a casino with my dad during a trip to Cambodia. That's where I was introduced to probability. After 
          only two bets and walking away $100 richer, I was hooked. Casino games and probabilistic events started occupying my thoughts. What began as researching ways to make 
          profitable bets quickly turned into a fascination with the theory of probability itself. During a New Year's trip to Vegas at the end of 2014, I remember sitting at a 
          craps table with my lifelong friend Jeffrey Wingo, telling him how fascinated I was by probability. He was studying physics at the time, and I explained that I felt 
          like probability was an invisible force guiding those dice. Jeff encouraged me to stop gambling and study Mathematics instead.

        <p>
          After leaving the Navy, I returned home and started classes at Hillsborough Community College. It was here, not in high school, that I discovered my love for learning. 
          During this time, I met my future wife, Ayana, and her four-year-old son, Luca, who I would later adopt. After two years and taking nearly every class the GI Bill 
          would pay for, I transferred to the University of South Florida.
          <br><br>  
          Like many math and science enthusiasts, I initially planned to pursue an engineering degree, following in my father’s footsteps. However, my passion for probability 
          was too strong to ignore. By my third year, I switched to studying statistics and felt more at home than ever before.
          <br><br>
          During my undergrad years, before I was qualified for serious data work, I held some unusual jobs. I started as a patient transporter, and later, I worked night shifts 
          transporting deceased individuals for funeral homes. I also spent some time as a contract scuba diver, cleaning the bottoms of boats. Finally, in 2019, I landed my first 
          data job as a data analyst for Wyndham Destinations and have been working professionally with statistics ever since.
          <br><br>
          After earning my Bachelor's degree in the subject, Ayana and I got married, and our family has continued to grow since.

      <h2>Balancing Stats, Family, and Fun: My Journey So Far</h2>

    <p>
      In 2021, my wife and I welcomed our first daughter, Samara, who’s now 3 years old. Our son, Luca, is 12 and has been all about track and field since late 2019, with 
      dreams of becoming a decathlete. Samara loves to dance (even if she can’t yet tell us her future plans), and my wife has taken up dancing too, aiming to compete in 
      West Coast Swing soon.
      <br><br>
      In 2022, I completed my Master’s in Statistics and Data Science, and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Central Florida with a focus in Probability and Sctochatic Calculus. 
      Over the years, I've become well-versed in statistical theory and now aim to deepen my mathematical expertise. Since starting my first data job in 2019, I've immersed myself in data and 
      have had the opportunity to collaborate with various research groups, both in academic and professional settings. Outside of work and studies, I’m balancing time to publish, 
      while also being a dedicated dad and husband.
      <br><br>
      When I do get a moment to myself, I enjoy dancing and staying active. I’m currently training for an Ironman triathlon, and I've started coaching youth track and field. Some
      long-term goals of mine include finishing my PhD, becoming CFA certified, hiking the entire Appalachian Trail, and moving out of the Sunshine State.

       It requires
 among other things the wit to comprehend complicated
 scientific problems, the patience to listen, the penetration
 to ask the right questions,<br>and the wisdom to see what is,
 and what is not, important. Finally, it requires from the
 statistitian the courage to wager his reputation each time
 an experiment is run. <br>
